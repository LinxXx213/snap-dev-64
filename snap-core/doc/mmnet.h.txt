/// TModeNet::Class
The class corresponding to one particular mode in a TMMNet.
This class contains only the set of nodes in that mode, and does not explicitly model edges.
For easy access to neighbors, there is a dense TIntV attribute for each CrossNet, which is a vector of edge ids of neighbors of our mode in that CrossNet.
///

/// TModeNet::CopyNodesWithoutNeighbors
All attributes of nodes in Src are copied except those which denote their neighbors in the multimodal network. If a node already exists in Dst, it is not overwritten, nor are its attributes.
///

/// TCrossNet::Class
The class corresponding to one particular CrossNet in a TMMNet.
Has a CrossNet name, and two modes. Can be either undirected or directed. If it is directed, it is directed in one direction only: from mode 1 to mode  2.
///

/// TCrossNet::CopyEdges
All attributes of edges in Src are copied. If an edge already exists in Dst, it is not overwritten, nor are its attributes.
///

/// TMMNet::Class
Represents a multimodal network. A mutimodal network is represented by composing TModeNets (disjoint sets of nodes) and TCrossNets (disjoint sets of edges that connect nodes in two TModeNets).
TMMNet contains methods to create TModeNets and TCrossNets by name, and returns pointers to them. All operations more granular than this, like adding nodes and edges, are run directly using methods provided in the ModeNets and CrossNets.
///

/// TMMNet::CopyModeWithoutNodes
All node attribute names and defaults are copied except those which denote crossnets incident to Src. All edge attribute names and defaults are deleted, as intra-mode edges should be represented by self-crossnets.
///

/// TMMNet::GetSubgraphByCrossNetMetapaths
Each row of \c Metapaths is a vector of crossnet ids in the multimodal network. Each vector must form a path through the mode connectivity graph, in the sense that the source mode of each crossnet must match the destination mode of its predecessor.
The orientation of each metapath's crossnets is determined by \c StartModeId. \c StartModeId must match \c Mode1 of the zeroth crossnet of each metapath if that crossnet is directed. If the zeroth crossnet of a metapath is undirected, either \c Mode1 or \c Mode2 may match it, and the other mode becomes the destination mode of the crossnet. 
For every subsequent crossnet in a metapath, \c Mode1 must match the destination mode of the previous crossnet if the current one is directed; otherwise, either \c Mode1 or \c Mode2 must match. The unmatched mode is treated as the destination of a crossnet when dealing with its successor.
All nodes whose ids are given in \c StartNodeIds must exist in the mode whose id is given in \c StartModeId.  
All ids of discovered modes, nodes, crossnets, and crossedges are preserved in the new network. All attributes of edges, and all non-crossnet attributes of nodes, are preserved as well, along with their attribute ids. Crossnet attributes of nodes are preserved if and only if those crossnets are listed in \c Metapaths. Crossnet attribute ids may not be preserved. 
///

/// TMMNet::GetMetagraph
The metagraph contains one node for each mode in the source multimodal network. It contains one edge for every directed crossnet in the network, and a pair of edges for every undirected crossnet (one per direction). The id of each node in the metagraph matches the id of its corresponding mode in the network. 
Each edge in the network may or may not match the id of its corresponding crossnet. If the crossnet was directed, its edge will match its id. If the crossnet was undirected, one of its edges will match its id (the one whose \c SrcNId equals the crossnet's \c Mode1 ) and the other edge will have an id greater than that of any crossnet in the source network. 
The metagraph has two node attributes: \c ModeName, a \c TStr that gives the name of the corresponding mode of the source network, and \c Weight, a \c TInt that gives the number of nodes in that mode. The metagraph has four edge attributes: \c CrossName, a \c TStr that gives the name of the corresponding crossnet, \c Weight, a \c TInt that gives the number of edges in the crossnet, \c Directed, a \c TInt that is 1 if the crossnet is directed and 0 otherwise, and \c Reverse, a \c TInt that gives the edge id of the reversed counterpart of an edge representing an undirected crossnet. If an edge represents a directed crossnet, \c Reverse is set to -1.
